# Battleship
The Battleship game application was developed with Test Driven Development (TDD) principles to ensure high-quality code and efficient testing. The project focused on isolating the application's functionality from DOM manipulation, which made it more flexible and easier to maintain. The application includes Ship, Gameboard, and Player classes with corresponding methods to track ship hits, sunk status, and attack locations. Additionally, a user-friendly interface was created with dynamic styling, including visual effects for hits and misses. Responsive design principles were employed to ensure the game is accessible on a variety of devices. Overall, the project aimed to provide a fun and engaging experience for users while demonstrating best practices in software development.
