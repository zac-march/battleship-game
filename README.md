# Battleship
The Battleship game application was developed with Test Driven Development (TDD) principles to ensure high-quality code and efficient testing. The project included:

* Isolating the application's functionality from DOM manipulation, making it more flexible and easier to maintain.
* Implementation of Ship, Gameboard, and Player classes with corresponding methods to track ship hits, sunk status, and attack locations.
* Creation of a user-friendly interface with dynamic styling, including visual effects for hits and misses.
* Use of responsive design principles to ensure the game is accessible on a variety of devices.

The project aimed to provide a fun and engaging experience for users while demonstrating best practices in software development.
